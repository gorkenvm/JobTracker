**Projects**

**"Pulse of Izmir" – Geospatial Sentiment & Complaint Analysis**

```
Scope : Analyzed massive datasets from social media and the Citizen Communication Center to
detect city-wide anomalies at the neighborhood and street level.
Technical Solution : Developed a multi-layered NLP pipeline utilizing Machine Learning to
perform hierarchical classification (Main Topic > Sub-topic > Root Cause). Integrated Google
Maps API to visualize spatial distribution.
Outcome : Delivered real-time statistical insights and citizen sentiment analysis to the Mayor via
a custom Telegram Bot, enabling data-driven urban management.
```
**Public Transport Analytics & Ferry Density Forecasting**

```
Scope : Managed high-volume transport data to solve inefficient expedition planning and high fuel
consumption issues for IZDENIZ.
Technical Solution : Established a Big Data infrastructure using Hadoop and PySpark for ETL
processes. Developed a hybrid forecasting model combining LSTM and LGBM to predict hourly
usage, visualized via PowerBI.
Outcome : Achieved over 90% prediction accuracy , directly leading to a redesigned expedition
schedule and optimized fuel consumption.
```
**Metropolitan Surveillance & Video Analytics System**

```
Scope : Created a customizable monitoring solution utilizing existing city camera infrastructure.
Technical Solution : Engineered a Computer Vision system allowing users to define specific
Regions of Interest (ROI) for detecting objects (people, vehicles, waste). Implemented real-time
object tracking, counting, and rule-based alert generation.
Outcome : Enhanced municipal oversight capability by automating the detection of
environmental and traffic violations.
```
**Advanced Park Security & Emergency Response System**

```
Scope : Designed an automated incident detection system for public parks to ensure safety and
rapid response.
Technical Solution : Built a multi-modal AI system (Audio + Video). The system detects specific
keywords combined with high-decibel audio triggers to activate cameras. Upon human
verification (police integration), it calculates the optimal intervention route.
Outcome : Reduced response times for emergency situations by providing verified, real-time
alerts to law enforcement.
```
**Automated Parliamentary Archiving (ASR & Diarization)**

```
Scope : Digitization and indexing of parliamentary sessions from audio recordings.
Technical Solution : Implemented an end-to-end Speech-to-Text ( ASR ) pipeline. Applied
Speaker Diarization algorithms to accurately distinguish and label different speakers in multi-
party discussions.
Outcome : Streamlined the archiving process, making historical speeches text-searchable and
accessible.
