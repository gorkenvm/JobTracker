**To: Epassi Senior Data Analyst - Power BI (f/m/d)**

**Dear Laura Mantere,**

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Data Analyst position at Epassi.
With a deep technical background in Data Science and a proven track record of managing
end-to-end data lifecycles, I am eager to contribute to Epassi’s mission of boosting well-
being across Europe by bringing clarity and structure to your German business operations.

**Why I am a Great Fit for Epassi** Epassi is at an exciting stage of growth through
acquisitions, and I thrive in environments that require transforming complex, evolving data
into trusted business assets. My professional journey in Machine Learning, Deep Learning,
and Generative AI began during my Master’s studies in 2017, giving me nearly a decade of
technical depth. I don’t just "report" data; I build the sustainable, automated
architectures—using Python, SQL, and modern data stacks—that allow businesses to
scale.

**Technical Leadership & Agile Execution** Beyond technical execution, I bring strong
organizational leadership. I am highly experienced in the **Agile Scrum** methodology, having
managed projects from initial planning to final deployment. I am comfortable taking
ownership of a roadmap, distributing tasks, and leading sprints to ensure that data
initiatives remain aligned with broader business goals.

**Commitment to the German Market** Two months ago, I made the strategic move to
Germany to bring my expertise to the global market. I am currently based in **Winsen
(Luhe)** , making me locally available for regular on-site collaboration at your **Hamburg**
office. My commitment to integrating into the local business culture is reflected in my
language journey:

- **English:** B2 level (fluent for professional environments, with prior experience
    working in English-speaking roles).
- **German:** Currently at an **A2 level** and actively progressing toward C1 through
    intensive courses.

**Why Epassi?** I am drawn to Epassi because of your reputation as one of Europe’s fastest-
growing companies. The challenge of integrating data from multiple acquired entities into a


unified, high-performing analytical engine is exactly where my skills in data architecture
and "builder" mindset provide the most value.

I am confident that my blend of technical mastery and project management experience
makes me an ideal candidate to own analytics for your German business. I look forward to
the possibility of discussing how my background can support Epassi’s continued success.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

**Veysel Murat Görken**
